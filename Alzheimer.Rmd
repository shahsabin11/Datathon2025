## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

##Installing packages:

```{r}
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```
```{r}
#Loading the dataset into the environment
Alzheimer <- read.csv("alzheimers_disease_data.csv")

```

```{r}
summary(Alzheimer)
glimpse(Alzheimer)
```


```{r}
# Removing unnecessary columns:

Alzheimer1 <- Alzheimer %>% 
  select(-BMI, -EducationLevel, -Diabetes, -HeadInjury, -Hypertension, -SystolicBP, -DiastolicBP, -CholesterolTotal, -CholesterolLDL, -CholesterolHDL, -CholesterolTriglycerides, -MMSE, -FunctionalAssessment)

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
